# my-app-routing
Create a new route that renders the &lt;Welcome/> component. The URL path should be /welcome/:name. :name represents dynamic data passed in via the URL. This data gets added to a match.params object that is passed as a prop to the component the Route renders. You would access the route with a URL like /welcome/davey. You can access the variable with props.match.params.name within the component. If the &lt;Welcome/> component is accessed through this URL, it should display the dynamic name from the URL. If the &lt;Welcome/> component is accessed through "/" route, it should maintain its original behavior and display the value passed in with the "name" prop. Update the Router functionality to show a 404 component when there is no matching route for the URL specified
